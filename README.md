# Dense Neural Networks to forecast stock returns

## For obvious reasons, I won't describe the specific architecture and feature engineering applied (nor allow to deduce it from the code). I'd rather keep it to myself. However, I will show the results obtained from it.
## There's no survivorship nor look-ahead bias, and it's been tested live to guarantee the validity of its results.
## The (exclusively) stocks in the portfolio, with no use of leverage and long-only positions, are equally weighted to obtain the result of such portfolio in each period.
## The prediction strategy has been trained and tested from short to long-term horizons (1/3/6/12 months into the future) for almost each month from 1991 till 2022. So there are 4 different models, one trained to predict 1 month ahead, another for 3 months ahead, and so on.
## The graphs shown below correspond to 1 model, as it would be too extensive to show graphs for each individual horizon. Even though graphs would be available for each of the 4 different horizons, only one is shown. However, the results from these 4 strategies plus the combination of them will be detailed further below the graphs.
